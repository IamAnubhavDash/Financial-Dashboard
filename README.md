Financial Dashboard

This is a simple financial dashboard I built using Python and Streamlit.
It fetches data from Yahoo Finance and allows you to explore stocks and crypto with an easy-to-use interface.

You can select a ticker and timeframe to see:

Price charts (line and candlestick)

Technical indicators such as EMA and Bollinger Bands

Basic performance metrics like daily returns and volatility

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/financial-dashboard.git
cd financial-dashboard


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Launch the app:

streamlit run financial_dashboard.py


The dashboard will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501
.

Tech Used

Streamlit for the interface

yFinance to fetch stock and crypto data

Pandas for data manipulation

Plotly for interactive charts

Possible Improvements

Add portfolio tracking

Integrate news and sentiment analysis

Deploy online for easier access

If you want, I can also write a polished requirements.txt and folder structure so you can upload everything directly to GitHub and it will look professional. Do you want me to do that?
