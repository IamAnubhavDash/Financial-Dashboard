Financial Dashboard

This is a lightweight financial dashboard built with Python and Streamlit that allows users to explore stocks and crypto with interactive charts and key performance metrics. The app fetches data from Yahoo Finance and provides candlestick and line charts, technical indicators such as EMA and Bollinger Bands, and basic performance metrics including daily returns and volatility. Users can select ticker symbols, date ranges, and rolling windows for calculations to customize their analysis. The dashboard is built using Python, Streamlit for the interface, yFinance to fetch market data, Pandas for data manipulation, and Plotly for interactive charts. Future improvements could include portfolio tracking with custom allocations, integration of news and sentiment analysis, and deployment on Streamlit Cloud or other hosting platforms for easier access. To run the app, clone the repository, install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt, and launch it with streamlit run financial_dashboard.py, which will open the dashboard in your browser at http://localhost:8501.
